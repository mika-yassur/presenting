      Drawing on some aspects of my precedent study, I’m interested in exploring ecocide in Gaza and the West Bank. I want in working across scales—to examine at soil toxified through military invasion, at aerial photographs and satellite images.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I found compelling about the methods used for ‘A Cartography of Genocide’ is that they integrated the granularity of data points with a meta-analysis of the military’s invasion and patterns of deliberate violence across aspects of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      While my visualizations will certainly take a different form, I am interested in counter cartographies and layers as a method or mode of analysis.

   NEW FADE-IN PARAGRAPH

      In terms of the colloquium theme, I’m interested in situating technology in its historical, political, and material contexts. I’m intrigued by the concept of ‘situatedness’ on micro and macro levels, along with Forensic Architecture’s theory of aesthetic sensing, thresholds of visibility, and minute observing.

      I am interested in sequencing, diptychs, and visual narration. I want to experiment with how design can be so fully imbued with theory. I am invested in the aesthetic properties of land and their roles in settler colonialism. I believe in and am critical of images. I am curious about sound. I am sometimes intrigued by the physicality of the digital (the pixel) (granularity). I am prone to loving beautiful things, elegance, delicate objects, organic forms, tendrils, accidental moments of composition, precision, and simplicity. I am interested in layers, both vertical and horizontal, assemblages, and mapping connections. I relate to the world and my intellectual work in visual, tactile, auditory, and linguistic ways. I am invested in the narratives that are revealed through marginalized modes of sensing, and the ways in which sensing, as a process, is visualized. I am curious about pixelated and pointal representations, including film and digital photographs and LiDAR. I am intrigued by the idea of photos not meant for the human eye.
    </p>
     New paragraph 
    <p class="delayed-fade-in-lower">
      Although I am sometimes pessimistic about the impact and importance of my work, there is a persistent part of me that believes that researching violence on large and small scales in Palestine is deeply important. Perhaps one of the rhetorical arguments of my work is that making both acts of violence and determined acts of resistance visible—literally and abstractly—might play a small part in Palestinian liberation.
